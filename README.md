# CardGames

These are some simple to code card games that students can easily grasp given the 
relative simplicity of the rules and implementation. (Programming should be fun!)

## Concept

Keep things easy to understand and make sure the code is accessible from a critical
thinking point of view.

## Implementation

This is done in Java and C, so far, to demonstrate languages to my students.

Everything in this design is Java 21 and C23 compatible.
